Copy file 'testing_dgesv-ex2.cpp' in the 'testing' directory and try
> make testing_dgesv-ex2
...

This produces compilation errors.

How to modify the ?? part of the code so that we solve the 
                 h_LU x = h_X
problem. Matrix h_LU has leading dimension lda and is of size N x N.
The right-hand sides are 'nrhs' and are sored in h_X with leading dim ldb
Put the pivots in ipiv.

Modify the code and in order to make sure the changes are correct, run the example 
with options that print error estimates, e.g.,
> aprun ./testing_dgesv-ex2 -l -c --nrhs 5
