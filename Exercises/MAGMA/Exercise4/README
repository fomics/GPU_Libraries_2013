Go to the 'src'	directory and
mv dgegqr_gpu.cpp dgegqr_gpu.cpp.bak
Next, copy file 'dgegqr_gpu-ex4.cpp' in dgegqr_gpu.cpp and try to compile
> make
...

This produces compilation errors.

How to modify the ?? part of the code so that this rourine correctly
represents the algorithm given in the presentation slides about
orthogonalizes a group of vectors - in this case the m x n vectors in
dA with leading dimension ldda.

Modify the code and in order to make sure the changes are correct, run the
example with options that print error estimates, e.g.,
> aprun testing_dgegqr_gpu -m 100000 -n 128 -c -l
