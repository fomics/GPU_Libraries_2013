             MAGMA Contributors' Guide

-----------------------------------------------------

The MAGMA program style follows the general guidelines for Sca/LAPACK 
in terms of interfaces, copyrights and licensing, citing the authors of the
software, and documentation:  
http://www.netlib.org/lapack-dev/lapack-coding/program-style.html



Routine Naming and Design
-----------------------------------------------
In general, follow existing LAPACK and MAGMA style.

To ease maintenance we encourage the use of BLAS.
Further, a double complex version of the software is maintained and the other
precisions are generated from it. To do this developers have to use the magma
routine and types naming conventions. 

* Determining Machine Parameters
The hardware used is queried once during the magma_init() are the parameters
are available for use by developers. We recommend using the parameters from
magma_init (instead of additional queries) in order to reduce overheads associated
with the calls. If needed, new parameters can be requested and will be added
for query in magma_init.

* Determining the Block Size for Block Algorithms
Block sizes, in contrast to LAPACK, are are not provided by the ILAENV routine.
Currently, the developer provides

extern "C" int magma_get_ROUTINE_nb(int m);

function (see control/get_nb_GPUNAME.cpp for examples) that returns the block
sizes based on the parameter m.



Language
-----------------------------------------------
MAGMA routines are called from the host, and the host software is written in 
C/C++. File names are given .cpp extension. The use of C++ features is subject of 
discussion with the MAGMA developers' team. 
Wrappers are provided to allow calling MAGMA routines from Fortran.


Source Formatting
-----------------------------------------------
In general, follow existing MAGMA style.


Testing and Timing Routines 
-----------------------------------------------
Testing and timing routines, following the MAGMA style in 'testing' , must be provided.
