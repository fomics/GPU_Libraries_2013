This produces compilation errors.

How to modify the ?? part of the code so that we find all eigenvalues
and eigenvectors of h_R with leading dimension lda, where the matrix
is of size size N x N.

Modify the code and in order to make sure the changes are correct, run the
example with options that print error estimates, e.g.,
> aprun ./testing_dsyevd-ex3 -l -c
