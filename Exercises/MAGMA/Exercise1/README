Copy file 'testing_dgetrf-ex1.cpp' in the 'testing' directory and try
> make testing_dgetrf-ex1
...

This produces compilation errors.

How to modify the ?? part of the code so that we perform a LU factorization
of h_A with leading dimention lda where the matrix size is M x N, and the 
resulting pivots are in stored in the 'pivots' array?

Run the example with different options, and in particular options that
print error estimates, e.g.,
> aprun ./testing_dgetrf-ex1 -l -c
